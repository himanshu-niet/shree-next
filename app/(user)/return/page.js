<dd className='faq-a mt-2 mb-4'>1) Well, we have a provision for that too but do remember - orders cancelled post 24 hours of confirmation are dealt with on a case-to-case basis by our Customer Care team depending on the degree of process completion.

<dt className='faq-q'>Oops! I "missed" adding a critical detail while placing the order. Possibility of correcting it?</dt>

<dd className='faq-a mt-2 mb-4'>

No worries. Such situations are often encountered when customers forget to :
<br/>
1) Update their complete shipping details;
<br/>
2) Update measurement attributes; or
<br/>
3) Verify or give their consent if required on certain pending notifications within the requested time
<br/>
As a policy, we try and reach out to our esteemed customers via their registered e-mail address. In case of non-receipt of any response, we try and give them a call. If we do not get a response in 15 days, we cancel the order and issue a Non-refundable Gift Card which the customers can use to place future orders with us. We share an update on the same via email as well.
<br/>
Remember, we try and keep our customers posted at each and every stage of their order with us and it really helps to have your inputs at the right time.
<br/>
However, if you wish to correct any aspect of shipping address or measurement post placing the order, please do get in touch with our Customer care base and we will assist you in the best possible manner.

<dt className='faq-q'>Why a "24 Hour" deadline?</dt>

<dd className='faq-a mt-2 mb-4'>
As soon as your order is confirmed, action is initiated at our end. The process of picking, packaging,customizing and logistics start, and the ordered product in most cases might have already passed through a couple of phases. In case a garment has to be customized, the process is already underway.Hence, we insist on a "24 hour" deadline.
